Ok, bit of a switch up.  My initial plan had me running through Free Code Camp tutorials, and I have to admit I lost a lot of motivation. As I've said I've done a fair bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the monotony of a from scratch HTML course weighed heavy on me, I lost motivation to continue, even though I could do it while doing other things at the same time (i.e watching rubbish series) and while I did learn a few things here and there I couldn't commit to that. I decided to take another approach, I need to be practical and build projects. I have a bunch of little projects I can resurrect but also new small ideas I would like to work through, I want to alternate between them, so I will post a new project every second day, and resurrect an old project every second day. This way there will be be new content (and practise every day). I still have a few key things I will need to learn through tutorials, and do want to improve my JavaScript through a couple of tutorials especially learn REACT and Three.JS\

Second change is the blogging platform, I've had a lot of recommendations in the past for blogger, and I play around with it before. I wanted something that was simple, preferably staying away from coding and an easy to use interface. Blogger is not that, the formatting through the standard text editor for posts is a mess adding additional HTML where it isnt needed (e.g 4 < h3 > tags around a sub heading, and completely random text sizing which for a short section took me almost an hour to fix), and while I could easily created it in Markdown the whole experience and customisation was limiting. Ive moved to using a headless CMS via Github/Netlify, its called Foundation and is built upon Gatsby. While initially it looks more technical it is infact must more user friendly, much more intuitive and a nicer and quicker experience for writing and up dating blogs. Over the next few days Ill be updating and moving accross everything I had on the Blogger site.
